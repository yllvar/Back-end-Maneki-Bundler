# Back-end-Maneki-Bundler

In the shadowy depths of the internet, where code whispers to the void, we've crafted something truly sinister yet hilariously delightful. Enter Maneki Bundler - the project where your dreams of blockchain dominance are either realized or shattered into a million digital pieces.

Installation: The Ritual
sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/maneki-bundler.git
cd maneki-bundler
# Behold the dark arts of package management
pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration: Summoning Your Daemon
Edit config.py: 
Here, you'll find the sacred keys to your digital empire. Replace the placeholder strings with your own dark secrets, like API keys and wallet addresses. Remember, with great power comes the great possibility of losing your shirt in a single transaction. Handle with care.

Usage: The Rite of Execution
Token Creation:
sh
python main.py --create-token --metadata "your token metadata here"
Warning: Creating tokens can be intoxicating. There's a fine line between creating a token and creating an addiction. Don't say we didn't warn you.

Jito Bundling:
sh
python main.py --bundle-jito
Note: This command will attempt to bundle transactions using Jito. If it fails, you might just end up with a bundle of regrets. Always keep your expectations low; it's less painful that way.

Testing: A Test of Your Soul
Run Tests: 
sh
python -m pytest -v tests/
Each test is a tiny demon unleashed to torment your code. If they pass, you've outsmarted the devils of bugs for now. But remember, they're always lurking, waiting for you to drop your guard.

Code Structure: A Map to Nowhere
config.py: Where the dark magic begins. Here lie the constants that will either guide or doom your transactions.
src/: A labyrinth of Python scripts. Enter at your own risk. Here, the token operations and Jito bundling are performed. Think of it as the heart of the beast, beating with malicious intent.
tests/: Where we attempt to ward off the chaos with some semblance of order. It's like trying to light a candle in a hurricane.

Contributing: At Your Peril
If you dare to add to this project, remember:

Code is like life: It's never truly done, only abandoned for others to refactor in despair.
Pull Requests are welcome: But be aware, every line of code you add is a step closer to the abyss.

Contact Us: The Cry for Help
If you find yourself lost in the depths of this project or if you've accidentally turned your tokens into digital dust, then sorry.
